# CryptoSec
CryptoSec tool for enctypting,decrypting,generating keys for AES,RSA,Ed25519 etc.


CRYPTO SEC The project was created during the HackYeah 2023 event in Krakow. We had 24 hours to write the script. 
The program was created for Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego. Created by Maksymilian Ostrowski (En1gm4_PL) and Daniel Kowal. 
I'm currently working on making the project an API! - with good results.
